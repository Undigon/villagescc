To Do
-----

Critical Path
-------------

Get SPF working on gmail.
- emails must be from web@villages.cc, with reply-to appropriately.

Set up www subdomain and redirect it.

Need memcached running?

Add more buffers to postgres.

Make logging good.
- Real IP address in django logs.

logrotate for nginx and apache logs.

robots.txt to prevent indexing of user data?
- bots can't set a location, so can't see feed, but can see profiles?
- tell bots to ignore locator, feed, and profiles
- add to privacy page that user data is not indexed by search engines

firewall to block ports to external traffic
- 8000, 9000, 5432 (postgres)
- block all and then add exceptions?
  - maybe just above 1024?

set up a backup!

invite first users!


Post-Launch
-----------

Move this into trac
- Add all code TODOs as well.

Donations page.
- Need Villages user to accept Ripple donations.

Set up quick tests of views to catch pages that blow up after changes.

Request acknowledgement
- have user setting to auto-acknowledge after N days?

Improve admin section
- add Settings (on Profile), Invitation, and other missing models.
- make some fields editable=False

Asynchronous task queue
- single process queue for data-modifying ripple transactions
- always make sure records needed to tasks are committed to db before task is
  dispatched (commit-per-view won't work)

Explain limited hearts in help.

Confirm acknowledge form before submitting, since it can't be undone.

Invitation requests should be feed items that any user can see and fulfill, 
by geographic area!

Let unregistered users click on links that go to pages only registered users
can see, but then show them the signup form?

Allow registered users to accept invitations by converting them directly to 
endorsements.
- Invitations to registered emails should auto-convert to endorsements.

Automatically route as much of a payment as possible, then complete the rest
by direct promise?
- no need for routed/direct selector on payment form
- how would users control if seller only wanted trusted routing?

Logs
- everything Ripple so it can be reconstructed
- log changes to email addresses so can make corrections if someone enters 
  wrong address and owner complains

View trusted acknowledgements
- must be trusted via someone other than acknowledgement recipient

Explanatory text where necessary
- links to help?
- slide-down help on every page?

- Developers of Villages are not responsible for any loss or harm from using

Ideas
-----

Breadcrumbs
- list of several previous pages visited

Sort searches by relevance, especially user searches
- ability to pay/be paid
- desirability of paying/being paid by?

Connect messages and payments to posts

Convert untrusted promise to trusted

In-site messaging system

Overall credit limits (in and out)
