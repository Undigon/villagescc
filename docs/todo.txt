Critical Path
-------------

Donations page.
- Need Villages user to accept Ripple donations.

Confirm acknowledge form before submitting, since it can't be undone.

SSL
- set session cookie to ssl only

User timezones?
- using relative times helps this
  - show signed up/last logged in times as relative?

Link to profile of sender in email notification/contact email.

Think about making usernames case-insensitive?

Log
- log changes to email addresses so can make corrections if someone enters 
  wrong address and owner complains
- who invited whom, to see who is bringing in spammers?

Invite Ripple group


To Do
-----

Move this into trac
- Add all code TODOs as well.

Make logging good.
- Real IP address in django logs.

Backup entire server tolle.ryanfugger.com.

Check backup is working.

Test restore from backup

Check logrotate is working

Add more buffers to postgres.
- currently at 28mb
- need to reconfigure the kernel with larger SHMMAX

Give someone else access to server in case

Set up quick tests of views to catch pages that blow up after changes.

Set up cron jobs for:
- cleaning expired sessions

Make it easy to use current location for posts.

Locator should show current location if different than home location.

Never redirect from locator to locator again, go to feed instead.

Request (claim?) acknowledgement
- have user setting to auto-acknowledge after N days?

Request undo acknowledgement (similar to request acknowledgement)

Subscriptions/email notifications
- new posts/people matching a particular filter

Improve admin section
- add Settings (on Profile), Invitation, and other missing models.
- make some fields editable=False

Asynchronous task queue
- single process queue for data-modifying ripple transactions?
- always make sure records needed to tasks are committed to db before task is
  dispatched (commit-per-view won't work)
  - maybe have some kind of task middleware where you can do:
  	import task; task.add(do_thing, args, kwargs)
	and then the middleware will pick it up and dispatch it after 
	view transaction is committed?

Explain limited hearts in help.

Invitation requests should be feed items that any user can see and fulfill, 
by geographic area!
- maybe have them fill out their profile first, so people can see who they are?

Let unregistered users click on links that go to pages only registered users
can see, but then show them the signup form?

Allow registered users to accept invitations by converting them directly to 
endorsements.
- Invitations to registered emails should auto-convert to endorsements.

Automatically route as much of a payment as possible, then complete the rest
by direct promise?
- no need for routed/direct selector on payment form
- how would users control if seller only wanted trusted routing?

Logs
- everything Ripple so it can be reconstructed

View trusted acknowledgements
- must be trusted via someone other than acknowledgement recipient

Split explanatory text into two parts:
- short overview bit
- longer explanation, hidden by default, slides down on clicking "More"

Filter posts by offer/want

Default email template with URL in sig

Acceptable use policy

Users should agree to terms of use?
- Developers of Villages are not responsible for any loss or harm from using
  the system.

Post expiry

Say whether acknowledgement was routed or direct on notification and on ack page
- may have to store in Payment model.

Cycle background colour on rows of long data tables

Multiple contact methods on profile
- add as many alternate contact methods as you want, list on contact page.

Enlarge image
- lightbox?
- highslide?

Last login != last online time - fix.

Delete profile

Forgot password/password reset

Nice base html email template

Automated tests for views

Better explanation of Ripple
- Ripple page with diagrams/video?

Design
- logo
- favicon
- helpful icons

Intro video

Weekly newsletter to all users
- opt out on settings.


Ideas
-----

firewall to block ports to external traffic
- 8000, 9000, 5432 (postgres)
- block all and then add exceptions?
  - maybe just above 1024?

Breadcrumbs
- list of several previous pages visited

Sort searches by relevance, especially user searches
- ability to pay/be paid
- desirability of paying/being paid by?

Connect messages and payments to posts

Convert untrusted promise to trusted

In-site messaging system

Overall credit limits (in and out)

Auto-increase endorsements after sufficient payoff?
