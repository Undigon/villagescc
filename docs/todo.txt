To Do
-----

Critical Path
-------------

firewall to block ports to external traffic
- 8000, 9000, 5432 (postgres)
- block all and then add exceptions?
  - maybe just above 1024?

invite more users!


Post-Launch
-----------

Move this into trac
- Add all code TODOs as well.

Make logging good.
- Real IP address in django logs.

Check backup is working.

Test restore from backup

Test failed backup cron job email warning.

Check logrotate is working

Add more buffers to postgres.
- currently at 28mb
- need to reconfigure the kernel with larger SHMMAX

Give someone else access to server in case

Donations page.
- Need Villages user to accept Ripple donations.

Set up quick tests of views to catch pages that blow up after changes.

Set up cron jobs for:
- cleaning expired sessions

Request acknowledgement
- have user setting to auto-acknowledge after N days?

Auto-increase endorsements after sufficient payoff?

Improve admin section
- add Settings (on Profile), Invitation, and other missing models.
- make some fields editable=False

Asynchronous task queue
- single process queue for data-modifying ripple transactions
- always make sure records needed to tasks are committed to db before task is
  dispatched (commit-per-view won't work)

Explain limited hearts in help.

Confirm acknowledge form before submitting, since it can't be undone.

Invitation requests should be feed items that any user can see and fulfill, 
by geographic area!
- maybe have them fill out their profile first, so people can see who they are?

Let unregistered users click on links that go to pages only registered users
can see, but then show them the signup form?

Allow registered users to accept invitations by converting them directly to 
endorsements.
- Invitations to registered emails should auto-convert to endorsements.

Automatically route as much of a payment as possible, then complete the rest
by direct promise?
- no need for routed/direct selector on payment form
- how would users control if seller only wanted trusted routing?

Logs
- everything Ripple so it can be reconstructed
- log changes to email addresses so can make corrections if someone enters 
  wrong address and owner complains

View trusted acknowledgements
- must be trusted via someone other than acknowledgement recipient

Explanatory text where necessary
- links to help?
- slide-down help on every page?
