Critical Path
-------------

First newsletter to users
- send newsletter feature in admin
- i'm stoked about the site and am serious about wanting to set up an economic
  village for myself to live in
- ask them to invite more people
- ask them for feedback, see if they need clarification on anything, questions?
- encourage reciprocal endorsement of inviters

Copy editing
- Wording improvements
  - endorsement -> thumbs up; endorse -> "give thumbs up"?
  - hearts -> thumbs up
  - acknowledge -> thank; acknowledgement -> thank you
  - N acknowledgement hours -> N hours of goodwill
- Rewrite How It Works as a real-world example
  - include how goodwill between friends integrates with the goodwill accounting
    we already do with each other
- Hannah's changes
- More explanation on acknowledgement page.

First feed search starts at 5km and keeps expanding until there are at least 20
items.

Location improvements
- Make it easy to use current location for posts.
- Change post location
- Option to have a post follow you when your location changes.
- manage multiple locations.
  - drop down of my locations on locator and post
  - my locations page to manage these locations

Encourage new users to endorse their inviter back

Log
- log changes to email addresses so can make corrections if someone enters 
  wrong address and owner complains
- who invited whom, to see who is bringing in spammers?

Set up cron jobs for:
- cleaning expired sessions
- maybe do with task queue?

Design
- colour scheme
- logo
- favicon
- helpful icons

Translations
- strings file
- Jorge Timon can do Spanish and maybe Portuguese

Request (claim?) acknowledgement
- have user setting to auto-acknowledge after N days?


To Do
-----

Move this into trac?
- Add all code TODOs as well.

User timezones?
- using relative times helps this
  - show signed up/last logged in times as relative?

Look into caching
- why don't template changes always show up immediately on production?

Make logging good.
- Real IP address in django logs.

Nicer welcome text for new users in area than blank feed and "no activity".
- could expand to show further away posts
- could say "welcome to area, you are the first", and "expand area to show more
  posts".

Backup entire server tolle.ryanfugger.com.

Check backup is working.

Test restore from backup

Check logrotate is working

Add more buffers to postgres.
- currently at 28mb
- need to reconfigure the kernel with larger SHMMAX

Give someone else access to server in case

Set up quick tests of views to catch pages that blow up after changes.

Locator should show current location if different than home location.

Never redirect from locator to locator again, go to feed instead.

Request undo acknowledgement (similar to request acknowledgement)

Subscriptions/email notifications
- new posts/people matching a particular filter

Improve admin section
- add Invitation, and other missing models.
- customize ModelAdmins
  - make some fields editable=False

Asynchronous task queue
- single process queue for data-modifying ripple transactions?
- always make sure records needed to tasks are committed to db before task is
  dispatched (commit-per-view won't work)
  - maybe have some kind of task middleware where you can do:
  	import task; task.add(do_thing, args, kwargs)
	and then the middleware will pick it up and dispatch it after 
	view transaction is committed?

Let unregistered users click on links that go to pages only registered users
can see, but then show them the signup form?

Allow registered users to accept invitations by converting them directly to 
endorsements.
- Invitations to registered emails should auto-convert to endorsements.

Set trusted/direct acknowledgement routing automatically by amount
- always prefer trusted if amount is low enough
- show max trusted when user enters amount, so it is clear what they are doing
- what if user wants to route the max, and send the rest directly?
  - could do it manually

Automatically unset endorsement_limited at a certain point:
- 20 endorsements incoming
- 2 endorsements from other unlimited users (1?)
- a certain acknowledgement volume in and out

Logs
- everything Ripple so it can be reconstructed

View trusted acknowledgements
- must be trusted via someone other than acknowledgement recipient

Split explanatory text into two parts:
- short overview bit
- longer explanation, hidden by default, slides down on clicking "More"

Filter posts by offer/want

Filter endorsement feed by sent and received.

Default email template with URL in sig

Acceptable use policy

Users should agree to terms of use?
- Developers of Villages are not responsible for any loss or harm from using
  the system.

Post expiry

Say whether acknowledgement was routed or direct on notification and on ack page
- may have to store in Payment model.

Cycle background colour on rows of long data tables

Multiple contact methods on profile
- add as many alternate contact methods as you want, list on contact page.

Enlarge image
- lightbox?
- highslide?

Last login != last online time - fix.

Delete profile

Forgot password/password reset

Nice base html email template

Automated tests for views

Better explanation of Ripple
- Ripple page with diagrams/video?

Intro video

Weekly newsletter to all users
- opt out on settings.

Fix 'X' in health when I endorse someone but they don't endorse me and
balance is zero

Load jquery locally rather than from google
- mix into js bundle


Ideas
-----

firewall to block ports to external traffic
- 8000, 9000, 5432 (postgres)
- block all and then add exceptions?
  - maybe just above 1024?

Breadcrumbs
- list of several previous pages visited

Sort searches by relevance, especially user searches
- ability to pay/be paid
- desirability of paying/being paid by?

Connect messages and payments to posts

Convert untrusted promise to trusted

In-site messaging system

Overall credit limits (in and out)

Auto-increase endorsements after sufficient payoff?

Have endorsement info built into profile feed item, and profile info page
- won't need endorsement feed anymore (although it might still be nice to have)

Have favourite users that you can filter your feed by

Invite with acknowledgement as well as endorsement?

Share posts to facebook, etc?
- hook to get new users signed up
- request invites to poster
