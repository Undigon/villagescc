To Do
-----

Critical Path
-------------

Review all TODOs in code

Make sure server can get client IP address for GeoIP


Post-Launch
-----------

Move this into trac
- Add all code TODOs as well.

Donations page.
- Need Villages user to accept Ripple donations.

Asynchronous task queue
- single process queue for data-modifying ripple transactions
- always make sure records needed to tasks are committed to db before task is
  dispatched (commit-per-view won't work)

Explain limited hearts in help.

Invitation requests should be feed items that any user can see and fulfill, 
by geographic area!

Let unregistered users click on links that go to pages only registered users
can see, but then show them the signup form?

Allow registered users to accept invitations by converting them directly to 
endorsements.
- Invitations to registered emails should auto-convert to endorsements.

Automatically route as much of a payment as possible, then complete the rest
by direct promise?
- no need for routed/direct selector on payment form
- how would users control if seller only wanted trusted routing?

Logs
- everything Ripple so it can be reconstructed
- email changes so can make corrections if someone enters wrong address
  and owner complains

View trusted acknowledgements
- must be trusted via someone other than acknowledgement recipient

Explanatory text where necessary
- links to help?
- slide-down help on every page?
