To Do
-----

Critical Path
-------------

Review all TODOs in code


Post-Launch
-----------

Donations page.
- Need Villages user to accept Ripple donations.

Invitation requests should be feed items that any user can see and fulfill, 
by geographic area!

Allow registered users to accept invitations by converting them directly to 
endorsements.
- Invitations to registered emails should auto-convert to endorsements.

Automatically route as much of a payment as possible, then complete the rest
by direct promise?
- no need for routed/direct selector on payment form
- how would users control if seller only wanted trusted routing?

Logs
- everything Ripple so it can be reconstructed
- email changes so can make corrections if someone enters wrong address
  and owner complains

View trusted acknowledgements
- must be trusted via someone other than acknowledgement recipient

Explanatory text where necessary
- links to help?
- slide-down help on every page?

Filter posts by offer/want

Asynchronous task queue
- single process queue for data-modifying ripple transactions
- always make sure records needed to tasks are committed to db before task is
  dispatched (commit-per-view won't work)

Default email template with URL in sig

Acceptable use policy

User timezones

Post expiry

Cycle background colour on rows of long data tables

Multiple contact methods on profile

Enlarge image
- lightbox

Request promise

Delete profile

Messages for every form success

Forgot password/password reset

Nice base html email template

Automated tests for views

Better explanation of Ripple
- Ripple page with diagrams/video?

Ideas
-----

Breadcrumbs
- list of several previous pages visited

Sort searches by relevance, especially user searches
- ability to pay/be paid
- desirability of paying/being paid by?

Connect messages and payments to posts

Convert untrusted promise to trusted

In-site messaging system

Overall credit limits (in and out)
