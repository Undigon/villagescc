To Do
-----

Critical Path
-------------

"Acknowledgement" instead of "promise"
- go over wording/presentation everywhere to make sure this is presented
as a gift you do that is acknowledged, rather than a sale that is traded
for an obligation

Icons
- heart (trusted) icon everywhere

Explain more about hearts/endorsements and hours/acknowledgements.

Default email template with URL in sig

Logged in logo link back to intro page
- handle logged-in users on intro page

Privacy notification on registration page
- profiles are public
- logged-in users can contact by email (no way to turn off)
- email is private
- transactions...
- everything else is basically public
- make a privacy static page to explain everything.

Nicer payment form
- "Ripple" heading is confusing.

Check every page to make sure it is self-explanatory.

Review all TODOs in code


Post-Launch
-----------

Invitation requests should be feed items that any user can see and fulfill, 
by geographic area!

Allow registered users to accept invitations by converting them directly to 
endorsements.
- Invitations to registered emails should auto-convert to endorsements.

Automatically route as much of a payment as possible, then complete the rest
by direct promise?
- no need for routed/direct selector on payment form
- how would users control if seller only wanted trusted routing?

Logs
- everything Ripple so it can be reconstructed
- email changes so can make corrections if someone enters wrong address
  and owner complains

View trusted acknowledgements
- must be trusted via someone other than acknowledgement recipient

Explanatory text where necessary
- links to help?
- slide-down help on every page?

Filter posts by offer/want

Asynchronous task queue
- single process queue for data-modifying ripple transactions
- always make sure records needed to tasks are committed to db before task is
  dispatched (commit-per-view won't work)

Acceptable use policy

User timezones

Post expiry

Cycle background colour on rows of long data tables

Multiple contact methods on profile

Enlarge image
- lightbox

Request promise

Delete profile

Messages for every form success

Forgot password/password reset

Nice base html email template

Automated tests for views


Ideas
-----

Breadcrumbs
- list of several previous pages visited

Sort searches by relevance, especially user searches

Connect messages and payments to posts

Convert untrusted promise to trusted

In-site messaging system

Overall credit limits (in and out)
